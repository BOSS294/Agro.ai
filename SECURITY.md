# Security Policy for Agriculture AI-Based Crop Disease Detection Repository
# 1. Introduction
This policy outlines the security measures and protocols for the Agriculture AI-Based Crop Disease Detection repository. The purpose of this repository is to provide a tool for detecting plant diseases through image uploads and offering potential solutions. Ensuring the security and integrity of this repository is critical to protect sensitive data, maintain system reliability, and safeguard intellectual property.

# 2. Access Control
Repository Access: Access to the repository is restricted to authorized personnel only. Ensure that only trusted collaborators have write access.
Permissions: Use GitHub’s built-in permission levels to manage access. For public repositories, limit sensitive information and code exposure. For private repositories, restrict access to the minimum number of users required.
